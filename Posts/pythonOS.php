<h1>My custom OS made with python</h1>
<h2>Mark 1</h2>
<p>June 24th 2021</p>
<p>so today i am doing to be talking about my os that i have started making. so lets get started. So i a wile ago i was getting into python and wigets and GUIS and i thought it was pretty cool. So i started making more. i Made a login screen that you could ether log in or sing up. So if you clicked log in it would ask you for your pascode that they had on file. If you inputed the right pascode it would start it up. But if you put the rong pascode it would just give a error syaing "Rong pascode."So when you put the Right pascode it would start the os witch right now is just a gui window. It has a dropdown menu on the top. When you click on it it will drop down the applications like a clock, maby a game, caulkulater, notepad and even a miny termial. It is still in the early stages but i hope to imporve this. Thanks you for reading all the way</p>
