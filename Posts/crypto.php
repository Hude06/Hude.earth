<h1>My Crypto-Origin</h1>
<p>It has always been interetsing that there was a online curency, but I had never really gotten into it. I got into it beacue my mom told me my dad was intersted in Bitcoin when it first came out. </p>
<p>I stared just watching videos and it was just cool how you could mine it, stake and you could buy and sell it. It just souded so cool. So on my laptop I downloaded some mining software to just lean more about cryto. But then I realized you have to have a really powerful coumputer. My laptop wouold take over a week to mine a penny thats not even electric. But then I found out you could mine on a raspberry pi a single board computer. It was still not fast but it was fun to set up. Then I got bored of it. But a couple months later I stumbled on a video of someone mining cryto with a arduino. I thought that was really cool. I had a couple lying around so I set up the software they were on. It was cool to see the price of DUCO coin fluxuate. To see how much I had made. One time it had spiced so much I would make 3$ per week. Thats just crazy. A couple days later I met a new freind and he was into investing. So he got me into investing. So my mom said I could start exchange the cryto I had mined for other cryto. I stated playing around. Now it is just fun looking at the difernt cryto prices. I hope you liked this story. Stay turned for the next. Thanks for watching Jude</p>
