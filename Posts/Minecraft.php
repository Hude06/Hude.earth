<h1>Raspberry pi minnecraft server</h1>
<p>July 16th 2021</p>
<p>So today i am going to be talking about my Minecraft server on my Raspberry pi. It is realy easy to set up. I am going to show you today how to set up a java minecraft server on a raspberry pi.So first you are going to need to flash rasbian to a micro sd card you can use something like ballenta etcher. you can use ubuntu or rasbian ubuntu is easier but in the blog post i am going to be using raspbian. So when you have the sd card plug it into the pi and hook up a keyboard, mouse and a monitor. When those are hooked up go to the teminal and type."sudo raspi-config"</p>
