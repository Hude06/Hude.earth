        <p>Hi, my name is Jude I like to build stuff with solar. I also like to program with microcontrollers. I live at a mission base, where we take bruised-up food and dry it out. We do this so we can ship it to different places that need it. In the summer we grow peaches.
            In the winter we make dried soup from different grains. Sometimes we even get donations of solar panels which I can use. I am actually in the process of hooking them up to my bedroom. Using ether a grid ty inverter or a powerwall on my wall.</p>
